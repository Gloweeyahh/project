Place your original image as `logo.jpeg` and this project will create a transparent version named `logo_transparent.png`.

Steps:
- Save the attached image to: `assets/logo.jpeg` (path: c:\Users\USER\OneDrive\Desktop\Tee work\assets\logo.jpeg)
- A transparent version will be automatically created as `assets/logo_transparent.png` (white/near-white pixels become transparent).
- `gmail_login.html` references `assets/logo_transparent.png` so no further changes are required.

If you want a different background-removal tolerance or additional editing (crop, resize), tell me and I'll run another pass.
